        All mordern websites and web applications are build using three
        fundamental techologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the
        languages of the web.

        In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn What HTML is all about,
        and why you too should learn it.

      <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
      <p>
        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language that
        web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage
        (not a programming language).
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
        paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand
        HTML and render HTML code as websites.
      </p>
      <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The opening tag</li>
        <li>The closing tag</li>
        <li>The actual element</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
